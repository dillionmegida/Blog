_This article was inspired by [this tweet](https://twitter.com/ekwonye/status/1455975172826177538?s=20). When I came across it, I recalled that it's a hack I've been using for a while and thought to share_

Responsiveness can be a bit tricky to get right. You'll see so many debates or building mobile-first or desktop-first--just so many suggestions based on opinions that work for people.

Well, here's just another trick that could make responsiveness more manageable.

## CSS Media Queries

Media queries are a way to target specific devices and screen sizes. By doing this, you can create or modify existing style declarations to target the current screen size. With media queries, you can:

- display a button on a desktop and hide it on a mobile device.
- use a large font size for a heading on a desktop, and smaller font on a mobile
- make a flex container wrap on a mobile device and cause it to un-wrap on a desktop

You can learn more about media queries here: [Media queries - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries).

The main thing to note here is that style declarations can be overwritten anywhere, including **inside of media queries**. This information will guide you throughout the rest of this article.

## CSS Variables

The term "variable" refers to a container that holds a value that can be changed. Variables are prevalent in programming languages and CSS, fortunately, is no exception.

Here's how variables are created and used in CSS:

```scss
.container {
  --padding: 20px;
  padding: var(--padding);
}
```

The double hyphen (`--`) used as a prefix for a custom property is used to declare a CSS variable, and that variable can be used as a value for any property using the `var()` function.

You can learn more about variables here: [Using CSS custom properties (variables) - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties).

As stated earlier, style declarations can be overwritten. And style declarations also include variable declarations. This means you can do the following:

```scss
.container {
  --padding: 20px;
  padding: var(--padding);
  --padding: 10px; // highlight-line
}
```

From the above, the `.container` element will have a `padding` of `10px` as the highlighted line has overwritten the earlier declaration.

## CSS Media Queries and Variables

From what we've seen above, it means you can do the following:

```scss
.container {
  --padding: 20px;
  padding: var(--padding);

  // highlight-start
  @media (max-width: 768px) {
    --padding: 10px; // highlight-line
  }
  // highlight-end
}
```

The above means, on a larger screen than 768px, the `.container` element will have a `padding` of `20px`. On a smaller screen, the `.container` element will have a `padding` of `10px`.

Now let's focus more on using this hack to make a responsive design more manageable.

## Making Responsive Design Easier

In the following non-exhaustive list, I'll show some ways you can achieve responsiveness using this hack.

### Control the number of columns in a grid container

If you were to control the number of columns in a grid container without a variable, you'd probably have something like this:

```scss
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);

  @media (max-width: 768px) {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
  }
}
```

To reduce the number of times you have to write `grid-template-columns`, you can do this:

```scss
.container {
  display: grid;
  // highlight-start
  --columns: 4;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(var(--columns), 1fr);
  // highlight-end

  @media (max-width: 768px) {
    --columns: 2; // highlight-line
  }

  // highlight-start
  @media (max-width: 480px) {
    --columns: 1;
  }
  // highlight-end
}
```

### Using variables for responsive font sizes

Using this hack, here's how you can change fonts across different screen sizes:

```scss
:root {
  --font-xl: 40px;

  @media (max-width: 768px) {
    --font-xl: 30px;
  }

  @media (max-width: 480px) {
    --font-xl: 20px;
  }

  @media (max-width: 320px) {
    --font-xl: 10px;
  }
}

h1 {
  font-size: var(--font-xl);
}
```

In the [`:root` selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:root), we defined a variable for font size and overwrote it for different screen sizes. Now in the `h1` element, we can use the variable, and depending on the screen size, the value for the font size will change.

_I'll add more examples here in due time. But I believe you already know how this hack can improve your development. You can use it in different suitable ways ðŸ™ƒ_
