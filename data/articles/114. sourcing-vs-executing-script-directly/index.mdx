You can execute a shell script (written in bash) in multiple ways; either by executing the script directly or executing the script with the `source` command. But what's the difference and when should you use which? ðŸ¤”

Let's say you have this simple bash script:

```zsh
filename=myScript.sh
#!/bin/bash

NAME="deeecode"
str="My name is $NAME"

echo "$str"
```

First, let's make the file [executable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable):

```bash
chmod +x ./myScript.sh
```

Now, you can execute this script directly in the terminal like this:

```bash
./myScript.sh
# My name is deeecode
```

Or you can use the `source` command:

```bash
source ./myScript.sh
# My name is deeecode
```

Both methods work fine, but here's where the difference comes in.

## Directly vs `source`

In `myScript.sh`, we have a variable called `NAME`. When we execute the script directly in the terminal, let's say we try to access the `NAME` variable:

```bash
./myScript.sh
# My name is deeecode

echo $NAME
#
```

Well, we get an empty string. That's because, the `NAME` variable is not available outside the executed script. I'll explain why in a second.

Let's now try to execute the script with `source`, and access the `NAME` variable afterwards:

```bash
source ./myScript.sh
# My name is deeecode

echo $NAME
# deeecode
```

Well here, the `NAME` variable is available even after the script is executed. Now, let's see why.

## Main process and Subprocesses

When you execute a script directly (like we did with `./myScript.sh`), you are creating a subprocess from the main process. After the script finishes execution, the subprocess is closed, which means every variable created, such as `NAME`, becomes unavailable:

```bash
# run command in main process
./myScript.sh

# --subprocess opens--
# code runs, NAME variable created
# NAME variable is accessible
# command is done running
# --subprocess closes--

# NAME no longer available in main process
```

{/* <Info>

</Info> */}

But when you use `source`, you are executing the `myScript.sh` script in the **main process**. So, every variable, like `NAME` is added to the main process. Even after the script finishes execution, **as long as the main process stays open**, `NAME` and any other variables declared stays available:

```bash
# run command in main process
source ./myScript.sh

# --still in main process--
# code runs, NAME variable created
# NAME variable is accessible
# command is done running
# --still in main process--

# NAME is available in main process
```

But when you close your terminal (or that process), then those variables become unavailable.

## Variables and Functions

We have seen so far how variables stay available in the main process when you use `source`. The same concept applies to functions. Let's see an example:

```bash
filename=myScript.sh
#!/bin/bash

print_info () {
  name=$1
  country=$2

  echo "$name lives in $country"
}

print_info Deeecode Brazil
```

Now, let's execute directly on the terminal:

```bash
./myScript.sh
# Deeecode lives in Brazil
```

Remember, a new subprocess was created for this, and closed after execution. So if we try to acess `print_info` now, watch what happens:

```bash
print_info John China
# command not found: print_info
```

Now we get an error. `print_info` was only available in the subprocess, and the subprocess is no longer available.

Now, let's use source:

```bash
source ./myScript.sh
# Deeecode lives in Brazil
```

Works fine when we execute the script. Now, let's try to access `print_info` in the terminal:

```bash
print_info John China
# John lives in China
```

As you see here, `print_info` is available in the main process...why? Because by using `source`, a new subprocess is not created for `./myScript.sh`. The script is run directly in the main process, thereby exposing variables and functions like `print_info` to the main process.

But also remember, when the main process is closed, everything exposed with `source` becomes unavailable.

## Wrap up

I hope the difference is clearer now. Executing a script directly creates a subprocess which closes after the script is done. But with `source`, you're able to expose variables and functions from those configuration files, so that you can use them in the main process.

Depending on your use case, you might prefer one approach better than the other.

If you've used process configuration files like `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` before, you'd notice that often times you're instructed to do `source .bashrc` when you make changes. Maybe now you understand why?

If you don't, I explain it [in this article](/p/sourcing-configuration-files).
