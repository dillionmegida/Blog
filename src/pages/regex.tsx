              JavaScript course
            </Link>{" "}
            which I announced earlier, to focus on this course I'm currently
            working on. I decided to take that pause because while planning for
            both courses, I was able to decide on an outline for this one
            quicker, so I thought to complete this first, before continuing with
            the JavaScript one.
            <br />
            <br />
            So do not worry, the JavaScript course will still be published in
            few months ðŸ˜‡
          </p>
          <h2>Why am I making this course?</h2>
          <p>
            The goal of this course is to simplify Regular Expressions to
            beginners and intermediates in the best way I can. The contents of
            this course can be applied to not just JavaScript, but other
            programming languages that support regular expressions.
            <br />
            <br />
            Regular expressions is a concept I've struggled with a lot in my
            programming journey. And when I think I finally understand it, I
            come across a challenge that makes me realize{" "}
            <i>"I still don't know this yet ðŸ˜•"</i>
            <br />
            <br />
            And I know I'm not the only one on this boat. So I took some time to
            learn and master regular expressions, and thought to also make it a
            course, simplified for others to learn. I made{" "}
            <NewTabLink
              link="https://twitter.com/iamdillion/status/1628124767428481044?s=20"
              className="a-link"
            >
              an announcement on Twitter
            </NewTabLink>{" "}
            for this course.
            <br />
            <br />I believe I'm good at simplifying topics, so I'm leveraging
            this skill to demystify Regular expressions ðŸš€
          </p>

          <h2>Topics I'll cover</h2>
          <p>
            I'll be covering a lot of topics including:
            <ul>
              <li>Quantifiers</li>
              <li>Character Classes</li>
              <li>Capturing Groups</li>
              <li>Lookarounds</li>
              <li>Alternations</li>
              <li>and so much more</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of these topics will have tasks that you can try out yourself,
            because:
            <blockquote>You learn better when you practice ðŸ˜‰</blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>
            We will also solve some Stackoverflow questions related to Regular
            expressions
          </p>
          <h2>Where will this course be published?</h2>
          <p>
            This course will be published on my YouTube channel:{" "}
            <NewTabLink
              className="a-link"
              link="https://www.youtube.com/c/deeecode"
            >
              DEEECODE
            </NewTabLink>
            . So if you haven't subscribed yet, do so, so that you will be
            notified when the course is published. The course will be in form of
            a playlist with many videos. Each of these videos will cover
            different topics including tasks. This way, it would be easy to
            refer to a topic, instead of having to navigate through a 2-hour
            long video.
          </p>
          <h2>When will it be published?</h2>
          <p>
            I cannot give a fixed time, but a flexible time is before the end of
            April. I'm currently{" "}
