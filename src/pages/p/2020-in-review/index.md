I'm thankful to God that I made it to the end of the year ðŸ’›

A lot happened this year. Even to me, personally. I never imagined I could be so depressed. But I'm grateful to God that things are getting better.

I'm super happy because I have a lot achievements this year.

To start with, expressing my proud-ness, Google my name ðŸ˜‡ [Dillion Megida google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=dillion+megida&oq=dillion+megida)

Personally, seeing the next page that follows on clicking that link gives me this sense of achievement. Not like I've done so much. Not like I've appeared on so many places. But it gives me this feel of "mehn, you're going places!"

## Mental-wise

A lot happened this year that drained my energy. Well, not exactly a lot of things, but one particular thing happened numerous times. I got worried at most times. I distracted myself with coding. Jump on my system, work on projects that helps me forget what's really happening. But then, when I close my system? It dawns on me that it isn't over yet.

In other to feel better, I learned something new about life.

> Be happy with what you have around you

You cannot 100% forget that you're going through pains, but you can ease them by finding happiness around yourself. Friends, outings, food and many other things around you.

I did this a lot, spent on myself a lot (very unusual) and that made my mental health better.

## Career-wise

This made the major parts of my achievement this year.
