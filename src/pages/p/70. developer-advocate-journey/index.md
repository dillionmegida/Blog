Drumroll 🥁🥁 please...

Welcome your new Developer Advocate 🥑 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

If you've been following up with me, you'd notice how hyped I've been about this Career Move. On [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6848997997380964352/), [my newsletter](https://dillionmegida.substack.com/p/dmwn-16-heres-a-platform-im-building), few WhatsApp groups and even [my YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/xz5UTuVKPx4), I shared this wonderful announcement.

Well, I'm joining [Stream as a Frontend Developer Advocate](https://twitter.com/iamdillion/status/1443201703218647044?s=21) and I'm excited to be a part of this amazing journey.

I shared my reason for transitioning on [my YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/xz5UTuVKPx4). Please check it out.

In summary, I'm looking for more opportunities to learn and grow as a Content Creator, to connect more with the community, to be "out there" more, and to help people to use the tools and products I work with/on more effectively. And I'm glad to be starting this new phase of my life with the wonderful team at Stream.

As I explore this new phase, I'll also be sharing my journey with you. I know Developer Advocacy is still a career unclear to some people, so as I learn more about it, I'll share them.

🥂 to a new journey...

Enjoy your week 😇
