### What is Immutability
Immutability is an attribute which stands for unchangeable. When an object is immutable, it is either unable to change or would never be changed in it's existence.
### What is Mutability
On the other hand, this stands for changeable. Objects possessing this attribute would change at some point.

### TL,DR;
> Try as much as possible to always work with immutable objects when coding.
