Heyyo 👋

This is not an article per se. It's a template for a cover letter.

## Why am I sharing this?

I have this cover letter format I've been using for my job applications. It has been able to land me some interviews, and two of my friends (one, a Game Developer, and the other, a Developer Advocate) also testified that they got an interview using it.

Note that this is not the best of templates. It's also lengthy, so if not used correctly (and/or just maybe the odds aren't in your favor), a recruiter won't even read it 🥲

Anyways, I hope you find this useful. And if you do, kindly consider sharing it with your friends, and also reach out to me on Twitter--[@iamdillion](https://twitter.com/iamdillion)--with your testimony. Also, if you have any questions or improvement-suggestions, please feel free to reach out to me.

I'll share the template, explain few points in the template, and also an example I've used before.

## The Template

### Subject

Application for the role of **[Job Title]**

### Body

Dear Hiring Manager,

I'd love to work for **[Company Name]**.

Why **[Company Name]**? **[Here, you state why you want to work for the company. What excited you about the company? What product got your attention? Why this company? You have to do your research obviously, so you can clearly state something about the company that matches your interests]**

> Here, you're showing the recruiter why you want to work for the company. Your cover letter shouldn't come off as a general email you sent to 50 job application emails. It should be tailored to the job you're applying for.

Why me? **[A little about you--who you are, what you love doing, your strengths and skills (ensure they align with the job's description)]**

> Here, you're showing why you're fit.

Here are some of my achievements below that'll make you consider my application:

- **[Achievement 1 with reference links]**
- **[Achievement 2 with reference links]**
- ...
- **[Achievement n with reference links]**

Am I fit for this? I believe I am. **[State that particular, special, or distinct attribute or skill that you possess that aligns so much with the role]**

> This part here should be very catchy. Try your best to make it clear that you have what it takes, or you're very willing to do what it takes

**[Optional]** Do you think I am fit? If you aren't, you can assess my skills with a task. **[Give some examples of tasks that you could be assessed with]**

> This part may come off like you're desperate, so it's okay if you don't want to add it. I add this part to show them how "confident" I am about the job, and how much I'd love to work for the company.

Looking forward to hearing more about this opportunity.

### Here's an example

Dear Hiring Manager,

I'd love to work for [redacted].

Why [redacted]? I love working on products that contribute to the growth of other businesses. I love the purpose that drives [redacted] and I believe I can contribute my skills to the continued success of the product.

Why me? I'm currently a Software Engineer and Technical writer who loves learning, teaching, and building web tools and applications. I haven't worked as a Developer Advocate but I've been wanting to transition to that role. I realized that I'd want to do more than building. I'd want to also share resources, teach online, and guide developers. I've been doing this as a Content Creator, but I want to explore more areas and reach out to more people as an official Developer Advocate.  I don't meet up with the 1-year Developer Advocacy requirement, but without that, I believe you'd still want to consider my application with my achievements below:

- Written over 66 articles on my website on various web technologies - [https://dillionmegida.com/blog](https://dillionmegida.com/blog)
- Published over 143+ contents (from videos to articles to talks) - [https://dillionmegida.com/contents](https://dillionmegida.com/contents)
- Written over 15+ articles on FreeCodeCamp ([https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/dillionmegida/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/dillionmegida/)) with over 12k+ weekly views and regular "Thank you, Dillion, for this article"s on Twitter : )
- Created over 10+ videos on my growing youtube channel ([https://bit.ly/2RMfqfX](https://bit.ly/2RMfqfX)) with an average of 800+ views per month
- I also create open-source packages once in a while. Here's my best: [https://github.com/dillionmegida/gatsby-remark-liquid-tags](https://github.com/dillionmegida/gatsby-remark-liquid-tags)

Am I fit for this? I believe I am. I'm passionate about community. The major reason I started writing was that I wanted people to learn from me, and I wanted to simplify things for people to understand. And as a constant learner, I love exploring new modern web technologies. I believe these skills will be valuable to the team. I'd love you to take a chance on me. I'm confident about this role.

Do you think I am fit? If you aren't, you can assess my skills with a task. I could share a video, write an article, or build an open-source package leveraging your product.

Looking forward to hearing more about this opportunity.
