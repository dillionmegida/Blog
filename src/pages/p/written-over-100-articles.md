Today makes it two years since I wrote my first technical article. My first tech article was [Making sticky column with grid area.](https://dev.to/dillionmegida/making-sticky-column-with-grid-area-5eph).

[Bolaji](https://twitter.com/iambolajiayo) was an inspiration for my first article. I always read his articles online, and one day felt, "I could also write something and have people learn from me too". At the time, I knew I didn't know so much, but I just wanted people to learn from me.

Over time, I've also done more than just articles. I've created contents in videos and podcasts. Here are [all my contents](/contents) I've created.
